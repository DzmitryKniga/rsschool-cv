###About me
Hey there! My name is Dmitry and I'm a beginner in Front-end development. I like writing codes, experimenting with it and seeing my results. I'm interested in programming because this field provides countless possibilities for development, you can  improve your skills no matter you are, independently of your location. And the most important thing is if you work hard, you can achieve a lot in development.
I'm an ex-officer, I worked for over 10 years in the armed forces of Belarus as an aircraft repair engineer. I left the armed forces in 2020 and now I'm a freelancer.
Now I learn a lot to improve my qualification and to improve my English knowledge.
I'm a hard-working person, I have strong communication, quick learning skills and I can work with a lot of data. I'd like to became a part of a cool team to take part in solving complicated tasks and projectdevelopment.
